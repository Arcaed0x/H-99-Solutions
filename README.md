# H-99-Solutions
This repository contains solutions to the H-99 problems on [Haskell.org](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems)

In the solutions I am practising my writing of algorithms
as well as the styling and structure of my algorithms to make sure that the code I write is easy to read , modular and maintainable.
When writing the Haskell code I am following [this](https://github.com/tibbe/haskell-style-guide/blob/master/haskell-style.md) guide to make sure everything is clean and readable.

The comment located at the top of each solution gives information such as:
